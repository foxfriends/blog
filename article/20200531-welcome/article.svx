I think it might be about time I started blogging. Why? Well, I don't know. I just feel like it.
I wouldn't have thought I'd enjoy writing or teaching or whatever this will become. Really I kind
of hated it whenever we had to write things in school. Turns out the issues were the content and the
motivation. I didn't really *care* about those things. I mean really, who *wants* to write an essay
on an old book, or a paragraph on workplace ethics? Nobody, that's who.

What I have found since then is that sometimes, when I am interested in what I am writing about, I
actually kind of enjoy it. I think they taught us how to write, but not why. I have found some why
for myself, and it comes in two parts:
1.  I kind of like teaching, and (sometimes) I come up with things that might be worth sharing. Most
    (all?) of it will be related to programming---that's really the only thing I'm any good at these
    days---but I won't restrict myself to that just yet.
2.  I like the way words look on paper. Or in this case, on screen (though at the time of writing,
    I have made the screen look like a paper). One of my (very few) interests in something that isn't
    programming is typography. Though, maybe it's more related than I think---I spend a lot of time
    looking at text, and it helps when it looks good.

I haven't really got much of a plan from here. I wanted to write, so I gathered some papers, but now I need
something to put on them. I suspect it will come. I had a lot of fun building this---it's built of hacks
on hacks on hacks but actually seems to have turned out. Maybe I'll tell you about it sometime. Maybe 
some of the other projects I've done in the last little while too.

We will see how this goes.
